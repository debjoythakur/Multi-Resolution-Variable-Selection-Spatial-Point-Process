# Multi-Resolution-Variable-Selection-Spatial-Point-Process
This project proposes a multi-resolution variable selection method for spatial point process data, motivated by crime and traffic accident occurrences in St. Louis. Using Haar wavelets and penalized likelihood, it identifies which predictors matter, where, and at what spatial scale.
